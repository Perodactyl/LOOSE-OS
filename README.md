# LOOSE OS
Loose OS is an operating system for OpenComputers. Someday it might even work for ComputerCraft. Or maybe I'll port OpenComputers to 1.19.2. Who knows?

My goal with LOOSE OS is you could compare it to OpenOS like you compare two linux distros. It doesn't do things the same way, but it achieves the same goal.

Loose OS runs on LOOSE BIOS. LOOSE BIOS is too big for an EEPROM, so you need to minify it. There is currently no installation method. I debug using Ocelot Desktop. To set it up in Ocelot Desktop, make a computer. Set it's EEPROM to `repo/loosebios2.lua` and give it a drive(Tier 2 or greater) and set it's address to `repo/`. Start the computer and it should work.
